## Artists
```{r}

  Show the distribution of the number of tracks each artist has in all tracks:

```{r}
all_tracks %>% group_by(artist_name) %>% 
  mutate(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "all artists", n)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  stat_summary(geom = "errorbar", fun.min = mean, fun = mean, fun.max = mean, width = .75, linetype = "dashed")+
  ggtitle("How many tracks each artist has in all tracks of popular playlists?") + 
  ylab("Track Count")

all_tracks %>% group_by(artist_name) %>% 
  mutate(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n)) + geom_histogram(color = "grey", fill = "lightBlue", 
                 binwidth = 25, boundary=0) 
```
 
# Tracks
```{r, warning=FALSE}

df2 <- all_tracks %>% group_by(track_name) %>% mutate(count=n(), track_artist = paste(track_name, artist_name, sep=" - "))
  
top_30_tracks <- df2 %>% group_by(track_artist) %>%
