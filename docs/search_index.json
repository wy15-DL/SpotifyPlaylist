Before, people buy albums and listen to the records in the order created by the musician. Now, audience create and listen to playlists created by ordinary people. The goal of this project is to analyze popular playlists created by Spotify users using visualizations and try to gain insights into why these playlists attract so many followers. I explored this question from aspects including the content (tracks, artist, albums) of playlists, audio features of tracks, choice of combining tracks, etc. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Datasets: 1. Main dataset: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-datasetchallenge#dataset 2. We can use the “spotifyr” package in r to query track and artist information The process of collecting data is first download the main dataset in the link. The downloaded directory consists of 1000 files each of which has information for 1000 playlists in json form. Then I wrote a program called found_popular.R (can be found in the main page) to iterate through each file and load them into a temporary dataframe to extract popular playlists with number of followers bigger than 500 to add to the pop_pl_500 dataframe that will be used to do data transformation. I included the process of why I chose the threshold of 500 to be popular playlists in chapter 3. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Load the data source of playlists which has more than 1 follower and plot their number of followers to help us to set a threshold for selecting popular playlists. The box plot above shows that there are few outliers that have more than 10000 followers, which results in a big range in y-axis and it’s difficult to determine the 75-quantile. Since only a few out of 1303 observations are such outliers, we can plot the number of followers for playlists with less than 10000 followers and use its value of 75-quantile as an approximation. From the four box plots with different upper bounds on the number of followers, we can see that the approximate fourth quarter of the number of followers starts at 250 and contains data with number of followers bigger than 500. Therefore, we define popular playlists as the ones having more than 500 followers. To analyze the tracks in each playlist, we try to unpack the field “tracks” in each observation. First, we plot the number of tracks in these playlists. As the box plot of the number of tracks shows that the middle 50% of the number of tracks are between 25 and 125 and the dash line show the mean value of around 85. Therefore, if we use all 1303 playlists of having more than 50 followers, the dataset of their tracks will be of size around (88 * 284) = 24140. We merge the tracks of all playlists into all_tracks for analysis on the contents of these popular playlists. Then, we create data frames for all tracks, artists, and albums. Important variables to keep for future analysis are their uri from which we can extract their ids, pid for tracks which is the playlist they are in, and count which is their frequency in all playlists. Finally, use spotify API to request information about the popularity of tracks, artists, and albums, and audio fetures of all tracks. Each important dataset is saved in .RData form for future load. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The original spotify million playlist data has 1000 json files each contains 1000 playlists. After plotting missing values for several files, we dicover that only the “description” field in “playlists” has missing values and about 98% playlists do not have descriptions. Considering the majority of playlists do not have this field, we decided to exlude it from our analysis. Below are plots of missing values in the first json file, which demonstrates our point. The first plot is for tracks and the second is for playlist basic information. After extracting the popular playlists with more than 50 followers, we plot its missing values: It show that about 93% of the observations does not have description. Considering the description field is not important for our exploratory analysis and assuming that the listeners might not pay attention to it when deciding whether they like listening to the playlist, we remove this field from our analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Contents of popular playlists 5.2 Popularity 5.3 Audio features", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Contents of popular playlists 5.1.1 Artists Show the distribution of the number of tracks each artist has in all tracks: The plot shows that most artists have smaller than 30 appearances on all the tracks of our popular playlists. 5.1.2 Tracks 5.2 Popularity Next, we examine if the popularity of artist affects the popularity of the playlists by computing the average popularity score of each playlist based on the popularity scores of artists in the playlist. Caculate and plot the average popularity score for each playlist based on popularity of its tracks. Plot popularity level of tracks versus their frequency in popular playlists to see if popularity of tracks contribute to popularity of playlists. The range of popularity variable in the spotify’s API of get_track is from 0 to 100, measuing a track’s popularity. The plot above shows that most tracks in our popular playlists are of low popularity, scores smaller than 10. This is not expected, and we investigate the popularity score further by plotting popularity scores of top 30 frequent tracks in popular playlists, which also shows that popularity and frequency in popular playlists of tracks are not correlated. Interestingly, the most frequent track, “All of Me” released in 2013 by John Legend, has a poopularity of 0, which indicates that the popularity score might be calculated based on its current streaming statistics instead of accumulative statistics. Also, given that the highest frequency is only 18 and there are 19579 distinct tracks in 287 popular playlists, the content of these playlists have a wide range of tracks and are not concentrated in a small set of tracks. Then for each playlist, caculate and plot the average popularity score of its tracks, artists, or ablbums. 5.2.1 Popularity Scores From the plots above, there is not a correlation betweem the number of followers and the average popularity score of tracks, artists, or albums for popular playlists. However, our popular playlists mostly have an average popularity score of between 20 and 60 for tracks, 30 and 75 for artists, and 20 and 60 for albums. 5.3 Audio features The function to get audio features of tracks in spotify API return features measuring specific indicators for tracks, such as danceability measuring how suitable a track is for dancing, energy measuring the track’s intensity and activity, acousticness measuring whether the track is acoustic and liveness measuring the confidence of detecting the presence of an audience in the recording. The above plots show that tracks in our popular playlists mostly have moderately high danceability and energy and low acousticness and liveness. Then we calculate the average of each audio feature among tracks for each playlist and plot them to show if they agree with the plots above. From the plots above, there is not a correlation betweem the number of followers and the avarage of the four audio features for popular playlists. However, our popular playlists mostly have an average of between 0.4 and 0.8 in danceabiliti, 0.5 and 0.75 in energy, 0 and 0.5 in acousticness, and 0.1 and 0.3 in liveness. Thus, we can say that popular playlists tend to have tracks that are high in danceability and energy, and low in acousticness and liveness, which agrees with the distribution of these features in tracks. Next, we investigate the super popular playlists that have number of followers biggher than 10000 First, we plot the populaity of all tracks in these super popular playlists, which shows that most of the tracks have moderately high popularities (unclear meaning of zero popularity from the Spoitify API). ##Choice of Combination Let’s see audio features of tracks for each of these super popular playlists, their correlations, and how these features vary in the order of tracks for each playlist. The correlation plot below shows that acousticness is negatively correlated with each of the three audio features. Then, we add a column to account for the percentage of duration of each track in its corresponding playlists so that the the computed percentage of all tracks in each playlist sums to 100. Based on this value, compute the accumulative percentage of duration for all tracks in each playlist. Since tracks in a playlist is in order of the streaming, the accumulative percentage of duration of a track can be seen as the time when the track is played if its corresponding playlist is being streamed and the whole duration of the playlist is 100. The four plots show that the the changes of danceability, energy, acousticness, and liveness in the ordered tracks of each super popular playlist varies greatly, and many playlists have tracks in the order of changing these audio features dramatically, even shifting them song by song. Overall, the danceabiility and energy values are mostly moderately high, while the acousticness and liveness are moderately low with spikes of tracks with high values. These plots indicates that super popular playlists usually choose a combination of tracks with various audio features and present them in the way of dramatic changes, which is consistent of many audiences’ listening behavior of mixing up songs with different features to avoid boredom.

Tracks in these popular playlists have a wide range and are not concentrated on a small set of hit records as hypothesized. The analysis of audio features of tracks in popular playlists show that most of them are of moderately high danceability and energy with moderately low liveness and acousticness. This finding reflects the current trend of electronic and hip-hop music which have those features and the unpopularity of acoustic and live music. It can lead to further investigation on the occassion where most people are listening to music. For example, are they listening to slow songs alone or at a party streaming dance music? The time series of the audio features of tracks in the ordering of streaming a whole super popular playlist indicates that these playlists mostly have tracks whose audio features are constantly changing. Even from one song to another, it can shift to the next that has completely different audio features. This variety demonstrates the creators of the playlists understand that music should be constanstly changing in order to avoid listeners’ loss of interest. The combination also shows that although the acousticness and liveness are mostly low, super popular playlists will sometimes have spikes in them, meaning creators inserting tracks that are more acoustic and like a live performance. These spikes also illustrate the pointing of mixing up tracks of different audio features in the reverse direction. The limitations of this project are downloaded from the spotify’s open million playlist chanllenge. These playlists are created between 2010 and 2017, so they might be outdated. Furthermore, spotify’s API does not discuss how they calculate the popularity score of a track. It is unclear if the score is for current streaming statistics or accumulative statistics. Some apparently popular tracks have popularity scores of zero. This might affect the accuracy of this project in terms of the contribution of the popularity of the playlist’s content.
