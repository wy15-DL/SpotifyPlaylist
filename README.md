The goal of this project is to analyze popularities of playlists on Spotify. We select popular playlists from the
"Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge" dataset downloaded from https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge/dataset_files, and do exploratory
data analysis on them from aspects of their contents, choices of combinations, target audiences, etc. The "spotifyr" package is used to query information about contents of playlists from Spotify's Web API.
